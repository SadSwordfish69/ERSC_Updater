# ERSC_Updater
This code installs / updates the Seamless Coop mod for elden ring. It uses my private data server, wich is not available for public use. To use this program, you need a .env with a url and a token.
Also there is an bat wich basically does the same but with a diferent setup. It needs to be places in the same directory as an folder named "UpdaterContent" in wich is the mod's exe and "SeamlessCoop" folder.
